# 🧠 AISEOTX
**AI SEO Texas** — an experimental project exploring how AI-driven search engines interpret, surface, and cite local businesses and digital brands.  
Built by [Bailes + Zindler](https://baileszindler.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=aiseotx), this project tests the future of **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** and **Answer Engine Optimization (AEO)** across AI-powered discovery platforms.

## 🔍 What Is AI SEO?
AI SEO focuses on visibility inside **AI search experiences** — from **Google’s Search Generative Experience (SGE)** and **Bing Copilot**, to **Perplexity AI**, **ChatGPT Atlas**, and other answer-first engines.

The goal:  
To understand how AI systems choose *which websites to cite*, *how structured data impacts retrieval*, and *what trust signals matter most* for inclusion in AI-generated results.
