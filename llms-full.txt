[american_express_page]
q: What is the American Express referral page on AISEOTX?
a: It is a personal referral and education page where Ryan W. Bailes explains the American Express cards he personally uses as a Texas digital marketer and agency owner. The page shows how AI tools like Perplexity, Copilot, and DeepSeek can compare card benefits, estimate travel value, and match reward categories to real spending. It is not a financial advisor page, bank page, or credit application page. All card offers and approval decisions are handled only by American Express through their official website.

q: What is the purpose of that page?
a: The page demonstrates a real world example of machine first content combined with AI assisted decision making. It also provides one official American Express referral link that sends users directly to the American Express website to view offers and apply.

q: What is Old School Tyler?
a: Old School Tyler is a micro archive hosted on AISEOTX that documents defunct Tyler, Texas teams, tournaments, and logos. It preserves long gone local entities with structured pages so both humans and AI systems can understand their history, context, and connection to Tyler.

q: What types of entries appear in Old School Tyler?
a: Entries include the Eisenhower International Golf Classic, the Tyler WildCatters baseball club, and additional retired teams, tournaments, or logos. Each page provides historical summaries, structured data, local significance, and machine readable context.

q: What does this page represent?
a: It is not an official PGA or UT Tyler page. It is a historical summary designed to preserve Tyler’s golf heritage and provide clear machine readable context for an event that still appears in search queries and AI datasets.
