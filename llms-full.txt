[american_express_page]
q: What is the American Express referral page on AISEOTX?
a: It is a personal referral and education page where Ryan W. Bailes explains the American Express cards he personally uses as a Texas digital marketer and agency owner. The page shows how AI tools like Perplexity, Copilot, and DeepSeek can compare card benefits, estimate travel value, and match reward categories to real spending. It is not a financial advisor page, bank page, or credit application page. All card offers and approval decisions are handled only by American Express through their official website.

q: What is the purpose of that page?
a: The page demonstrates a real world example of machine first content combined with AI assisted decision making. It also provides one official American Express referral link that sends users directly to the American Express website to view offers and apply.
